## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 completion, the project has:

-   Working blog utilities in `apps/web/lib/blog-utils.ts` with frontmatter parsing
-   BlogPost data model established with proper TypeScript interfaces
-   Content structure with sample posts in `content/blog/` directory
-   Established testing patterns with Jest + React Testing Library (67 tests passing)
-   Working build process with SSG support and proper metadata handling

### Architecture Context

**System Architecture**: [Source: architecture/high-level-overview.md]
The system adopts a Jamstack architectural style, focusing on pre-rendering content at build time for blazing speed and enhanced SEO. Blog content is managed as Markdown files within the repository, processed by a Static Site Generator.

**Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
BlogPost data model includes:

-   `id`: string - Unique identifier (e.g., UUID or slug)
-   `slug`: string - URL-friendly identifier (e.g., `my-first-post`)
-   `title`: string - Title of the blog post
-   `date`: string - Publication date (ISO format, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`)
-   `author`: string - Author's display name
-   `category`: string - Primary category (e.g., 'HLD', 'LLD', 'Fullstack')
-   `tags`: string[] - Array of keywords/tags
-   `summary`: string - A short description for listings and SEO
-   `thumbnailUrl`: string - URL to a thumbnail image for the post
-   `likes`: number - Counter for article likes
-   `commentCount`: number - Counter for total comments
-   `visits`: number - Custom counter for unique article visits

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/system-components.md]

-   Frontend: Next.js (SSG), React 19.x.x, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, MagicUI
-   Data Access Layer: React Query / SWR, TypeScript
-   Build Process: Next.js built-in SSG

**Blog Content Service**: [Source: architecture/system-components.md]

-   Manages retrieval and processing of blog post content
-   Reads Markdown files from the repository at build time
-   Processes metadata and content for static generation
-   Static Content Generation: Processes Markdown files and generates static HTML pages and metadata via Next.js's SSG
-   Metadata Retrieval: At build time, reads the frontmatter from each Markdown file to create a list of all BlogPost metadata

### File Locations

Based on established project structure: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

-   Dynamic blog post page: `apps/web/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
-   Blog content source: `content/blog/*.md` files (established in previous story)
-   Utility functions: `apps/web/lib/blog-utils.ts` (extend existing)
-   Test files: `apps/web/__tests__/blog-post.test.tsx` and component tests
-   Route structure follows: `apps/web/app/(blog)/[slug]/page.tsx` pattern from source tree

### Technical Constraints

**Static Site Generation Requirements**:

-   Use Next.js SSG with `generateStaticParams()` for dynamic routes
-   All blog content must be processed at build time
-   Implement proper error handling for missing posts (404 pages)

**Content Structure Requirements**:

-   Blog posts follow two-part structure: Theory and Implementation sections
-   Markdown content processing must preserve structure and formatting
-   Syntax highlighting required for code snippets in Implementation sections

**Styling Standards**: [Source: previous story implementations]

-   Use Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
-   Follow responsive design patterns from existing components
-   Maintain typography consistency with existing pages
-   Use Shadcn UI components where applicable

**Error Handling**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Implement graceful degradation for missing posts
-   Use structured error handling patterns
-   Display user-friendly error messages
-   Proper 404 handling for non-existent slugs

### Project Structure Notes

The individual blog post functionality aligns with the existing project structure:

-   Dynamic route follows Next.js App Router conventions in `apps/web/app/blog/[slug]/`
-   Content management uses existing `content/blog/` directory structure
-   Extends existing blog utilities without breaking previous functionality
-   Testing follows established Jest + React Testing Library patterns

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

Based on current project setup and established patterns:

-   **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured)
-   **Test Location**: `apps/web/__tests__/blog-post.test.tsx` for page tests, component-specific test files for individual components
-   **Test Execution**: `npm run test --workspace=web`
-   **Test Coverage Requirements**:
    -   Dynamic route generation and static params functionality
    -   Blog post content fetching and parsing utilities
    -   Page rendering with various content structures (Theory/Implementation)
    -   Syntax highlighting functionality for code blocks
    -   Error handling for missing or malformed blog posts
    -   Metadata display and SEO optimization
    -   Responsive design and accessibility features
-   **Test Data**: Use existing mock blog post data and create additional test content for edge cases
-   **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure proper heading structure, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

## QA Results

### Review Date: January 31, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **excellent code quality** with comprehensive SSG support, proper error handling, and well-structured components. The developer has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with attention to performance, maintainability, and user experience. The codebase follows Next.js 15 best practices and maintains consistency with the established project architecture.

### Refactoring Performed

-   **File**: `apps/web/components/BlogPostContent.tsx`
    -   **Change**: Optimized content parsing logic from inefficient split/find operations to direct regex matching
    -   **Why**: The original implementation used `split()` followed by multiple `find()` operations which created unnecessary array iterations and temporary arrays
    -   **How**: Replaced with direct regex matching using `/^## Theory\s*$\n([\s\S]*?)(?=^## Implementation\s*$|$)/m` and `/^## Implementation\s*$\n([\s\S]*?)$/m` patterns, added early return for empty content, improving both performance and readability

### Compliance Check

-   **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Proper error handling with graceful degradation, structured component architecture, follows React/Next.js best practices
-   **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect** - All files placed in correct locations per architecture guidance, follows established naming conventions
-   **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **Comprehensive** - 15 thorough test cases covering edge cases, error scenarios, and content parsing variations
-   **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Fully Implemented** - Every acceptance criterion thoroughly satisfied with additional enhancements

### Improvements Checklist

-   [x] Optimized content parsing algorithm for better performance (BlogPostContent.tsx)
-   [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
-   [x] Validated SSG implementation with proper static params generation
-   [x] Confirmed syntax highlighting integration with custom styling
-   [x] Verified SEO metadata generation with OpenGraph and Twitter cards
-   [x] Validated error handling for missing posts (404 behavior)
-   [x] Confirmed responsive design and accessibility considerations

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** The implementation properly:

-   Uses server-side file reading with path validation
-   Implements proper error boundaries and graceful degradation
-   Sanitizes markdown content through react-markdown with secure plugins
-   No sensitive data exposure or XSS vulnerabilities detected

### Performance Considerations

**Strong performance implementation:**

-   **SSG Optimization**: Proper use of `generateStaticParams()` for build-time optimization
-   **Content Parsing**: Optimized regex-based parsing (refactored during review)
-   **Bundle Size**: Efficient use of react-markdown with tree-shaking-friendly imports
-   **Lazy Loading**: Component properly structured for Next.js automatic optimizations
-   **Code Splitting**: Dynamic route structure enables proper code splitting

### Technical Excellence Highlights

1. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Proper async params handling for App Router
