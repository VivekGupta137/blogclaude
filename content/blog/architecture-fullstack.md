# Full Stack Architecture Design

A comprehensive guide to designing scalable and maintainable full stack applications.

## Theory

Full stack architecture involves careful consideration of frontend, backend, database, and deployment strategies.

## Implementation

```typescript
// Example of a typical full stack architecture pattern
interface AppArchitecture {
  frontend: 'React' | 'Vue' | 'Angular';
  backend: 'Node.js' | 'Python' | 'Java';
  database: 'PostgreSQL' | 'MongoDB' | 'MySQL';
  deployment: 'AWS' | 'Vercel' | 'DigitalOcean';
}

const architecture: AppArchitecture = {
  frontend: 'React',
  backend: 'Node.js',
  database: 'PostgreSQL',
  deployment: 'Vercel'
};
```
