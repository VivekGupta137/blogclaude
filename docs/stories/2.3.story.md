# Story 2.3: Categories & Tags

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** blog reader,
**I want** to filter blog posts by category and tags,
**so that** I can find content that is relevant to my interests.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The blog list page includes a filter or navigation component for categories and tags.
2. Clicking a category or tag filters the list of blog posts to show only relevant articles.
3. The URLs are updated to reflect the current filters (e.g., `/blog?tag=react`).
4. The filters work correctly, and the list of posts updates dynamically.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Stories 2.1 and 2.2 completion, the project has:

-   Working blog utilities in `apps/web/lib/blog-utils.ts` with `getBlogPosts()`, `getBlogPostBySlug()`, and frontmatter parsing
-   BlogPost data model established with `category` and `tags` fields
-   Blog list page at `/blog` with BlogPostCard components displaying posts
-   Individual blog post pages at `/blog/[slug]` with full content rendering
-   Established testing patterns with Jest + React Testing Library (82 tests passing)
-   Content structure with markdown files in `content/blog/` directory
-   Build process with SSG support and proper metadata handling

### Architecture Context

**Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
BlogPost model includes filtering-relevant fields:

-   `category`: string - Primary category (e.g., 'HLD', 'LLD', 'Fullstack')
-   `tags`: string[] - Array of keywords/tags (e.g., `['Microservices', 'Redis', 'TypeScript']`)

These fields are extracted from frontmatter during build-time processing and are available for filtering operations.

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md (file was empty, using previous story context)]

-   Frontend: Next.js (SSG), React 19.x.x, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, MagicUI
-   State Management: Built-in React hooks, Next.js router for URL state
-   Build Process: Next.js built-in SSG with static generation

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

-   Blog route structure: `apps/web/app/(blog)/page.tsx` (existing blog list page)
-   Components: `apps/web/components/` for reusable filter components
-   Utilities: `apps/web/lib/blog-utils.ts` (extend existing functions)
-   Tests: `apps/web/__tests__/` for component and integration tests

### File Locations

Based on established project structure:

-   Blog list page (to modify): `apps/web/app/blog/page.tsx`
-   Filter components: `apps/web/components/CategoryFilter.tsx`, `apps/web/components/TagFilter.tsx`
-   Blog utilities (extend): `apps/web/lib/blog-utils.ts`
-   Test files: `apps/web/__tests__/blog-filters.test.tsx`, component-specific test files
-   Content source: `content/blog/*.md` files (frontmatter contains category and tags)

### Technical Constraints

**Static Site Generation Requirements**:

-   Filtering must work with SSG - all possible filter combinations should be statically generated or use client-side filtering
-   Category and tag data must be extracted at build time from markdown frontmatter
-   Use Next.js App Router patterns for URL state management

**URL State Management**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md + Next.js patterns]

-   Use `useSearchParams` hook for reading query parameters
-   Use `useRouter` with `push` method for updating URL
-   Maintain browser history compatibility for back/forward navigation
-   Support multiple query parameters (e.g., `?category=HLD&tag=react&tag=typescript`)

**Error Handling**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Graceful handling of invalid filter parameters
-   Empty state display when no posts match filters
-   Proper fallback when filter data is unavailable

**Styling Standards**:

-   Use Tailwind CSS for responsive filter component styling
-   Follow established design patterns from existing BlogPostCard components
-   Use Shadcn UI components where applicable for consistency
-   Implement hover states and active filter visual feedback

### Project Structure Notes

The filtering functionality extends existing blog infrastructure:

-   Builds upon existing blog utilities and data models
-   Integrates with current blog list page layout
-   Maintains compatibility with existing BlogPostCard components
-   Follows established component organization patterns

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

Based on established project patterns:

-   **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured with 82 tests passing)
-   **Test Location**: `apps/web/__tests__/blog-filters.test.tsx` for integration tests, component-specific test files for individual components
-   **Test Execution**: `npm run test --workspace=web`
-   **Test Coverage Requirements**:
    -   Filter utility functions (getUniqueCategories, getUniqueTags, getFilteredBlogPosts)
    -   Filter component rendering and user interactions
    -   URL parameter handling and state synchronization
    -   Complete filtering workflow with various filter combinations
    -   Empty state handling when no posts match filters
    -   Browser navigation compatibility (back/forward)
-   **Test Data**: Use existing mock blog post data with various categories and tags
-   **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support for filter controls

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Rating: âœ… Excellent Implementation**

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural decisions, clean code practices, and comprehensive functionality. The developer has successfully created a well-structured filtering system that meets all acceptance criteria while following established patterns and best practices.

**Strengths:**
- Clean component architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Consistent TypeScript usage with proper type safety
- Effective use of React hooks (useMemo, useCallback) for performance optimization
- Proper URL state management with browser history support
- Accessible UI components with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Reusable utility functions following DRY principles

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/web/components/BlogListWithFilters.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced useEffect + useState with useMemo for filtering logic
- **Why**: Eliminates unnecessary re-renders and state updates, improving performance
- **How**: Direct computation of filtered posts using useMemo provides better React optimization

**File**: `apps/web/lib/blog-utils.ts`
- **Change**: Extracted shared `filterBlogPosts` function to eliminate code duplication
- **Why**: Prevents inconsistencies between client-side and server-side filtering logic
- **How**: Created pure function that can be reused across different contexts

**File**: `apps/web/components/CategoryFilter.tsx`
- **Change**: Added comprehensive accessibility attributes and ARIA labels
- **Why**: Ensures screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation support
- **How**: Added role="group", aria-pressed, aria-describedby, and sr-only description

**File**: `apps/web/components/TagFilter.tsx`
- **Change**: Enhanced accessibility with keyboard event handling and focus management
- **Why**: Provides full keyboard accessibility for tag selection and removal
- **How**: Added onKeyDown handlers, tabIndex, role attributes, and focus ring styling

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: âœ… Full compliance with error handling patterns and graceful degradation
- **Project Structure**: âœ… Proper file organization following established patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: âœ… Comprehensive test coverage across utilities, components, and integration
- **All ACs Met**: âœ… Every acceptance criteria implemented with additional polish
