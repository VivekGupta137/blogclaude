# Story 1.4: Deployment Pipeline

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** project owner,
**I want** an automated deployment pipeline,
**so that** my code is automatically built and deployed to Vercel on every commit.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run linting, unit tests, and integration tests on every push.
2. The project is linked to Vercel via Git integration.
3. Pushing code to a feature branch creates a Preview deployment on Vercel.
4. Merging a pull request to `master` triggers a production deployment.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Task 1: Set up GitHub Actions workflow (AC: 1)
    -   [x] Create `.github/workflows/` directory
    -   [x] Create CI workflow file with Node.js setup
    -   [x] Configure linting step using `npm run lint`
    -   [x] Configure type checking step using `npm run type-check`

    -   [x] Create `vercel.json` configuration file for monorepo setup
    -   [x] Configure Vercel project settings for Next.js app in `apps/web`
    -   [x] Set up Git integration to link repository with Vercel
    -   [x] Configure preview deployments for feature branches
    -   [x] Configure production deployments for master branch
-   [x] Task 3: Test deployment pipeline (AC: 1, 3, 4)
    -   [x] Create test feature branch and verify Preview deployment
    -   [x] Verify GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
    -   [x] Test production deployment by merging to master
    -   [x] Validate all tests pass in CI environment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From previous stories (1.1-1.3), the project has:

-   Monorepo structure with `apps/web` (Next.js 15.4.5) and `packages/shared`
-   Established testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library
-   Working lint (`npm run lint`) and type-check (`npm run type-check`) commands
-   Comprehensive unit tests already created for existing pages
-   Build process (`npm run build`) working correctly

### Architecture Context

**System Architecture**: [Source: architecture/technical-summary.md]
The system is a modern, static site generated application (SSG) with client-side interactivity, using a component-based frontend framework following Jamstack architectural style with content pre-rendered at build time.

**High Level Overview**: [Source: architecture/high-level-overview.md]
Jamstack architectural style focusing on pre-rendering content at build time for blazing speed and enhanced SEO. The application will be served as static assets from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Monorepo repository structure housing both frontend application code and shared TypeScript types.

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/system-components.md]

-   Frontend: Next.js (SSG), React 19.x.x, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, MagicUI
-   Data Access Layer: React Query / SWR, TypeScript
-   Build Process: Next.js built-in SSG

### File Locations

Based on established project structure:

-   GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
-   Vercel configuration: `vercel.json` (project root)
-   Package scripts already exist in `package.json` and `apps/web/package.json`

### Testing Requirements

**Current Testing Setup**: [Source: apps/web/package.json]

-   Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured)
-   Test scripts: `npm run test` and `npm run test:watch`
-   Test files location: `__tests__` directories or `.test.tsx` files
-   Comprehensive test coverage already established in previous stories

**CI Testing Requirements**:

-   Run `npm run lint` - ESLint validation
-   Run `npm run type-check` - TypeScript type checking
-   Run `npm run test --workspace=web` - Jest unit tests
-   All must pass before deployment

### Technical Constraints

**Deployment Platform**: Vercel (implied from acceptance criteria)

-   Must support Next.js SSG deployment
-   Git integration for automatic deployments
-   Preview deployments for feature branches
-   Production deployments for master branch

**Monorepo Configuration**:

-   Root workspace with apps/_ and packages/_ structure
-   Main application in `apps/web` directory
-   Shared types in `packages/shared`

**Security Considerations**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Never commit secrets or API keys to repository
-   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
-   Structured logging without exposing sensitive data

### Project Structure Notes

The deployment pipeline aligns with the existing project structure:

-   Monorepo setup supports centralized CI/CD
-   Next.js App Router in `apps/web` is SSG-ready for Vercel
-   Package scripts already configured for build, lint, and test operations
-   Testing infrastructure is complete and ready for CI integration

## Testing

### Testing Standards

Based on current project setup and previous story implementations:

-   CI must run all existing test suites without modification
-   Jest + React Testing Library framework (already configured)
-   Test execution via `npm run test --workspace=web`
-   All existing tests must continue to pass in CI environment
-   Type checking via `npm run type-check --workspaces --if-present`
-   Linting via `npm run lint --workspaces --if-present`

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The deployment pipeline implementation is solid and follows industry best practices. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with a clean, maintainable approach. The GitHub Actions workflow and Vercel configuration demonstrate good understanding of CI/CD principles for modern JavaScript applications.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - **Change**: Enhanced CI workflow with environment variables, caching, timeout controls, and optimized build steps
  - **Why**: Improves build performance, reliability, and maintainability. Adds production environment variables and CI-specific optimizations
  - **How**: Added env variables for Node version, enhanced caching strategy, timeout protection, and conditional artifact uploads

- **File**: `vercel.json`
  - **Change**: Enhanced Vercel configuration with security headers, performance optimizations, and function constraints
  - **Why**: Adds essential security headers (HSTS, XSS protection, frame options) and optimizes static asset caching
  - **How**: Added security headers, static asset caching rules, function memory/duration limits, and offline-first npm installation
