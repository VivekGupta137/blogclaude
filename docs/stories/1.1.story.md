# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Basic Structure

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a new Next.js project initialized with the specified monorepo structure,
**so that** I have a clean and organized codebase to begin building upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project is initialized using Next.js with the App Router.
2. The monorepo structure is set up with an `apps/web` for the Next.js app and `packages/shared` for shared types.
3. A basic root `layout.tsx` is created in `apps/web/app/` with a default HTML structure.
4. All core dependencies (e.g., Tailwind CSS, TypeScript) are configured.
5. A `content/blog/` directory is created, and a sample Markdown file is added for future content.
6. A `README.md` file is created at the project root with basic setup instructions.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context exists.

### Architecture Context

**System Architecture**: [Source: architecture/technical-summary.md]
The system will be a modern, static site generated application (SSG) with client-side interactivity, using a component-based frontend framework. It follows a Jamstack architectural style with content pre-rendered at build time for performance and SEO.

**Monorepo Structure**: [Source: architecture/high-level-overview.md]
A monorepo repository structure will be employed, housing both the frontend application code and potentially shared TypeScript types or utility functions for future backend components. This allows for streamlined development and consistent tooling.

**Content Management**: [Source: architecture/high-level-overview.md]
Blog content will be managed as Markdown files within the repository, processed by a Static Site Generator.

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/system-components.md]

-   Frontend: Next.js (SSG), React 19.x.x, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, MagicUI
-   Data Layer: React Query / SWR, TypeScript
-   Build Process: Next.js built-in SSG

**File Locations**:

-   Main app: `apps/web/`
-   Shared types: `packages/shared/`
-   Blog content: `content/blog/`
-   Layout: `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`

**Error Handling Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Use structured `ApiError` object for backend-to-frontend communication
-   Implement centralized error handling at key boundaries
-   Design frontend for graceful error degradation

**Logging Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Use lightweight, production-ready logging library (pino or Next.js native)
-   Structured format (JSON) with standard levels: info, warn, error, fatal
-   Never log sensitive user data, PII, or secrets

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy**: No specific testing strategy documentation found in architecture docs. Standard Next.js testing practices should be followed with unit tests for components and integration tests for key flows.

### Technical Constraints

-   Must use Next.js with App Router (not Pages Router)
-   TypeScript is required throughout the project
-   Must follow monorepo structure for future scalability
-   Content must be stored as Markdown files for static generation

### Project Structure Notes

The monorepo structure aligns with the architecture requirements for separating frontend application code and shared utilities. The `content/blog/` directory placement supports the static site generation approach for blog content.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

Based on architecture requirements:

-   Test file location: Follow Next.js testing conventions (likely `__tests__` or `.test.ts` files alongside components)
-   Testing frameworks: Standard Next.js testing setup (likely Jest + React Testing Library)
-   Testing requirements: Unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for build process

**Overall Quality: Excellent** - The implementation demonstrates strong architectural choices and follows modern Next.js best practices. The monorepo structure is well-organized, dependencies are current and properly configured, and the codebase establishes a solid foundation for future development.

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean monorepo architecture with proper workspace configuration
- Comprehensive TypeScript setup with strict type checking
- Modern Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router implementation
- Well-configured Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS integration
- Solid testing foundation with Jest and React Testing Library
- Excellent documentation and project structure

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Completely redesigned homepage component with improved UX and accessibility
- **Why**: Original had redundant structure, hardcoded font references, and poor user experience
- **How**: 
  - Removed redundant main element (already in layout)
  - Added gradient typography and better visual hierarchy

- **How**:
  - Added detailed JSDoc comments for all interfaces and types
  - Improved ApiError type with specific error codes union
  - Added BlogCategory enum for type safety
  - Enhanced type safety with `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any`

**File**: `apps/web/lib/utils.ts`
- **Change**: Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples
- **Why**: Utility functions should be well-documented for team understanding
- **How**: Added detailed documentation explaining purpose, parameters, return value, and usage examples

**File**: `apps/web/__tests__/Home.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Enhanced test coverage for improved component structure
- **Why**: Tests needed updating after component refactoring and should cover more functionality
- **How**: Added tests for navigation links, semantic structure, and accessibility
