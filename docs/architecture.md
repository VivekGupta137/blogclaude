# High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

The system will be a modern, **static site generated application (SSG) with client-side interactivity**, focused on delivering a rich user experience for consuming technical content. It will primarily leverage a **component-based frontend framework** to present interactive resume details and a structured blog with "Theory" and "Implementation" sections. The application will be deployed as static assets for optimal performance and scalability, with dynamic content (like comments and visitor metrics) managed through integration with **third-party services and client-side JavaScript**. This architecture prioritizes visual appeal, content delivery, and ease of maintenance, supporting the goal of establishing a strong industry presence.

## High Level Overview

The system will adopt a **Jamstack architectural style**, focusing on pre-rendering content at build time for blazing speed and enhanced SEO, with dynamic functionality provided through API calls to external services. The application will be served as static assets from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A **monorepo repository structure** will be employed, housing both the frontend application code and potentially shared TypeScript types or utility functions for future backend components (e.g., a custom API for comments or newsletter). This allows for streamlined development and consistent tooling across potentially interconnected parts of the project. User interaction will flow from the client-side, interacting with embedded third-party services for comments and analytics, and consuming pre-rendered blog content. Blog content will be managed as **Markdown files within the repository**, processed by a Static Site Generator.

Architectural and Design Patterns
For your blog, we'll lean into the following key patterns:

Jamstack Architecture: Utilizing a static site generator for pre-rendered content and external APIs/client-side JavaScript for dynamic features.

Rationale: This aligns perfectly with your goals for high performance, excellent SEO, and minimal hosting costs, while still supporting interactive elements like comments. It offers a secure and scalable foundation for a content-heavy site.

Component-Based UI: Structuring the frontend using reusable UI components.

Rationale: This promotes maintainability, scalability, and reusability, essential for building an appealing and interactive resume and blog. It will allow you to build complex interfaces from smaller, self-contained units.

Markdown-Driven Content: Storing blog posts as Markdown files within the repository.

Rationale: This simplifies the content creation workflow, provides version control for articles, and integrates seamlessly with Static Site Generators for efficient content rendering. It's a developer-friendly approach to blogging.

# Data Models

This section defines the core data models/entities, reflecting their storage and usage with Next.js and Upstash (Serverless Redis). Shared TypeScript interfaces will ensure type safety across frontend and backend (Server Actions).

## Data Models

-   **Purpose:** To represent metadata and dynamic interaction counts for an individual article. The full Markdown content resides in the repository and is processed by Next.js at build time.
-   **Key Attributes:**

    -   `id`: `string` - Unique identifier (e.g., UUID or `slug`).
    -   `slug`: `string` - URL-friendly identifier (e.g., `my-first-post`).

    end

All functions returning a Promise<T> should be wrapped in a way that the client can handle either a successful response or a structured error response.

Authentication and Authorization
All Server Actions that require a user to be logged in must first retrieve the user's session.

The Session object is extended by the NextAuth.js adapter to include an isAdmin: boolean flag. This flag is authoritative and is a server-side value that cannot be manipulated by the client.

All actions requiring administrator privileges must perform a server-side check to ensure session?.user?.isAdmin === true before proceeding. An unauthorized request will throw an ApiError with the PERMISSION_DENIED code.

Data Models Reference
Comment: The data model for a single comment.

UserProfile: The data model for a user's profile.

1. Comment Endpoints (Server Actions)
   createComment({ postId, userId, content, parentId }): Promise<Comment>

Purpose: Allows an authenticated user to submit a new comment.

Permissions: Requires a valid, authenticated user session.

Error Codes: PERMISSION_DENIED (if not authenticated), VALIDATION_ERROR (if input is invalid).

getCommentsForPost(postId): Promise<Comment[]>

Purpose: Retrieves all comments for a specific blog post.

Error Codes: NOT_FOUND (if the post does not exist).

deleteComment(commentId): Promise<boolean>

Purpose: Deletes a specific comment.

Permissions: CRITICAL: This action requires the user to be an administrator.

Error Codes: PERMISSION_DENIED (if not an administrator), NOT_FOUND (if the comment does not exist).

2. Analytics Endpoints (Server Actions)
   incrementLikes(postId): Promise<number>

Purpose: Increments the like counter for a given blog post.

Error Codes: NOT_FOUND (if the post does not exist).

incrementVisits(postId): Promise<number>

Purpose: Increments the unique visit counter for a given blog post.

Error Codes: NOT_FOUND (if the post does not exist).

3. User Endpoints (Server Actions)
   updateUserProfile(userId, updates): Promise<UserProfile>

Purpose: Updates a user's profile, such as toggling the newsletterOptIn flag.

Parameters: userId (the ID of the user to update) and updates (an object with fields to update).

Permissions: CRITICAL: This action must perform a server-side check to ensure userId matches the session.user.id to prevent one user from updating another's profile.

Error Codes: PERMISSION_DENIED (if not authorized), NOT_FOUND (if the user does not exist), VALIDATION_ERROR (if update data is invalid).

Returns: The updated UserProfile object.

4. User Endpoints (NextAuth.js)
   getSession(): Promise<Session | null>

Purpose: Fetches the current user's session data.

Returns: A Promise that resolves to the Session object, which includes the isAdmin: boolean flag.

## Database Schema

```markdown
# Database Schema

This section outlines the concrete data structures and key naming conventions for the project's data, which will be stored and managed in **Upstash (Serverless Redis)**.

#### Data Access Patterns

-   We will primarily use **Redis Hashes** to store individual data objects (`Comment`, `UserProfile`).
-   We will use **Redis Sorted Sets** and **Sets** to manage collections and implement functionality like chronological ordering and unique memberships.
-   We will leverage **Redis's atomic commands** (`INCR`, `ZCARD`) for counters to ensure data integrity during concurrent updates.
-   All data access will be handled exclusively by the Next.js Server Actions to ensure a single, consistent source of truth and to enforce data integrity and security.

#### 1. Blog Posts

-   **Homepage Metadata Index:** A Redis Sorted Set will be the primary source of truth for all blog posts. It will store a lightweight, JSON-encoded object containing only the metadata required to render the homepage list. This significantly improves performance by avoiding multiple database lookups.

    -   **Key:** `blog:posts:by-date`
    -   **Value:** `string` (JSON-encoded object with `{ slug, title, summary, date, thumbnailUrl }`)
    -   **Score:** `timestamp` of the post's publication date.

-   **Individual Post Metadata Hash:** A Redis Hash will store the remaining, full metadata for a specific blog post. This is fetched only when a user visits the individual post page.
    -   **Key:** `post:meta:{slug}` (e.g., `post:meta:my-first-hld-post`)
    -   **Fields:**
        -   `author`: `string`
        -   `category`: `string`
        -   `tags`: `string` (JSON-encoded array)
-   **Dynamic Counters:** Simple Redis keys will store the likes and visits. These are managed with atomic commands.
    -   **Key:** `post:likes:{slug}` (e.g., `post:likes:my-first-hld-post`)
    -   **Value:** `number`
    -   **Key:** `post:visits:{slug}` (e.g., `post:visits:my-first-hld-post`)
    -   **Value:** `number`

#### 2. Comments

-   **Individual Comment Hash:** Each comment will be stored as a Redis Hash.
    -   **Key:** `comment:{id}` (e.g., `comment:uuid-12345`)
    -   **Fields:**
        -   `postId`: `string`
        -   `userId`: `string`
        -   `authorName`: `string`
        -   `authorImage`: `string`
        -   `content`: `string`
        -   `timestamp`: `string`
        -   `parentId`: `string` (optional)
-   **Post-to-Comments Index:** A Redis Sorted Set will list all comment IDs for a given post, sorted by timestamp. The total number of comments will be derived from this set's size using `ZCARD`.
    -   **Key:** `post:comments:{postId}` (e.g., `post:comments:my-first-hld-post`)
    -   **Value:** `comment:id`
    -   **Score:** `timestamp` of the comment's creation date.

#### 3. User Profiles

-   **User Hash:** Each user will be stored as a Redis Hash. This is the source of truth for user profile data.

    -   **Key:** `user:profile:{userId}` (e.g., `user:profile:google_12345`)
    -   **Fields:**
        -   `email`: `string`
        -   `name`: `string`
        -   `image`: `string` (optional)
        -   `newsletterOptIn`: `boolean` (local UI flag; subscription managed by an external service).
        -   `lastVisitTimestamp`: `string`
        -   `commentsPosted`: `number`
        -   `isAdmin`: `boolean`

-   **Relationships:**

    -   A `UserProfile` can post many `Comment`s.

-   **Redis Mapping:** Stored as a Redis Hash (e.g., `user:profile:{userId}`).

## Infrastructure and Deployment

```markdown
# Infrastructure and Deployment

This section defines the deployment architecture, CI/CD pipeline, and operational strategy for the project, leveraging the inherent capabilities of Next.js and Vercel.

#### Infrastructure as Code

-   **Tool:** Vercel Configuration (Implicitly via `vercel.json` file in the root).
-   **Approach:** For this project, the core infrastructure (hosting, CDN, serverless functions) is managed and configured directly by Vercel's platform through its Git integration and a minimal `vercel.json` file. This minimizes the need for a separate, complex Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution, keeping the project simple and focused.

#### Deployment Strategy

-   **Strategy:** **Git-based Continuous Deployment via Vercel.** Vercel automatically deploys every new commit pushed to a Git branch.
-   **CI/CD Platform:** **Vercel (built-in)** for deployment and **GitHub Actions** for pre-deployment quality checks.
-   **Pipeline Configuration:** The workflow will be as follows:
    1.  A developer pushes code to a branch on GitHub.
    2.  A GitHub Action is triggered to run the test suite and linting.
    3.  If tests pass, a build is automatically triggered on Vercel.
    4.  **Preview Deployments:** Every pull request gets a unique, public Preview URL.
    5.  **Production Deployments:** Merging to the `main` branch automatically triggers a production deployment.

#### Environments

We will maintain three primary environments to ensure a safe and reliable deployment process.

-   **Development (Local):**
    -   **Purpose:** For local development and testing.
    -   **Details:** The project runs locally via `npm run dev` or a similar command, with a local database and environment variables.
-   **Staging (Preview):**
    -   **Purpose:** For testing, QA, and stakeholder reviews of new features before they go live.
    -   **Details:** Vercel automatically deploys a new Preview URL for every Git branch/Pull Request. This environment is ephemeral and tied to a specific branch.
-   **Production (Live):**
    -   **Purpose:** The live, public-facing website.
    -   **Details:** This environment is linked to the `main` branch. Only code that has passed through Staging and been merged to `main` is deployed here.

#### Rollback Strategy

Vercel provides a robust, built-in rollback mechanism. If an issue is discovered in production, the rollback is as simple as reverting to a previous successful deployment directly from the Vercel dashboard. This allows for a fast and reliable recovery with minimal manual effort.
```

# Error Handling Strategy

This section defines a comprehensive approach to handling errors consistently across the fullstack application, from the user interface to the backend Server Actions and data persistence layer.

## Coding Standards

-   **Structured Errors:** We will use a structured `ApiError` object for all backend-to-frontend communication, as defined in the API contract. This ensures consistent error responses that are easy for the frontend to parse and handle.
-   **Centralized Handling:** Errors will be caught and handled at key boundaries in the application, such as at the top level of Server Actions and within API service wrappers in the frontend. This prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the application.
-   **Graceful Degradation:** The frontend will be designed to handle errors gracefully, displaying user-friendly messages instead of raw error codes or broken interfaces.

#### Logging Standards

-   **Library:** We will use a lightweight, production-ready logging library for the backend, such as `pino`, or leverage Next.js's native logging capabilities in Server Actions.
-   **Format:** Logs will be in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to make them easily searchable and parsable by log management tools.
-   **Levels:** We will use standard logging levels: `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.
-   **Required Context:** Each log entry must include key information for debugging, such as:
    -   `timestamp`: A clear timestamp.
    -   `level`: The log level (e.g., `info`, `error`).
    -   `message`: A human-readable message.
    -   `requestId`: A unique ID to trace a single request's journey through the system.
    -   **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:** **Never log sensitive user data, personally identifiable information (PII), or secrets (API keys, etc.).**

#### Error Handling Patterns

-   **External API Errors (e.g., social login with NextAuth.js):**

    -   **Retry Policy:** For transient network errors, a simple retry with exponential backoff will be implemented (if supported by the library).
    -   **Circuit Breaker:** For repeated failures from an external service, a circuit breaker pattern may be used to prevent excessive requests and to fail fast.
    -   **Error Translation:** Errors from external services will be caught and translated into our internal `ApiError` format before being returned to the frontend.

-   **Business Logic Errors (e.g., `deleteComment` without admin role):**

    -   **Custom Exceptions:** We will use the custom `ApiError` interface to define specific error conditions.
    -   **User-Facing Errors:** The error message should be concise and helpful to the user (e.g., "Permission Denied" rather than a technical stack trace).
    -   **Error Codes:** We will use the predefined error codes (`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`) for predictable client-side error handling.

-   **Data Consistency (e.g., Upstash Redis):**
    -   **Transaction Strategy:** We will use Redis's transaction features where multiple operations need to be atomic to ensure data consistency. For example, incrementing a `commentCount` might be part of a single transaction that also writes a new `Comment` hash.
    -   **Idempotency:** Where possible, operations that can be retried (e.g., submitting a form) will be made idempotent to prevent duplicate data from being created if a request is sent multiple times.

# Coding Standards

These standards are **MANDATORY** for all developers, including AI agents. This section provides a concise set of rules and conventions to ensure a clean, consistent, and maintainable codebase.

#### Core Standards

-   **Languages & Runtimes:** The project will exclusively use **TypeScript** with **Node.js 20.x.x (LTS)**.
-   **Style & Linting:** Code formatting will be enforced using **Prettier** for style consistency. **ESLint** will be used to enforce code quality and identify potential bugs. The `apps/web` application and the `packages/shared` package will have their own `.eslintrc` configurations.
-   **Test Organization:** Unit and integration tests for components will be co-located with the component files (`component.test.tsx`). E2E tests will be in a separate `apps/web/tests/` directory.

#### Naming Conventions

Consistent naming is essential for a clean codebase. All developers must adhere to the following conventions:

| Element                         | Frontend (Next.js)                          | Backend (Server Actions)     | Example                                       |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Components**                  | `PascalCase`                                | -                            | `UserProfile.tsx`                             |
| **Hooks**                       | `camelCase` with `'use'` prefix             | -                            | `useAuth.ts`                                  |
| **Server Actions**              | -                                           | `camelCase` with action verb | `createComment`, `deleteComment`              |
| **API Routes**                  | -                                           | `kebab-case`                 | `/api/blog-posts`                             |
| **Database Tables**             | -                                           | `snake_case`                 | `user_profiles`                               |
| **TypeScript Types/Interfaces** | `PascalCase`                                | `PascalCase`                 | `UserProfile`, `Comment`                      |
| **Files/Directories**           | `kebab-case` or `PascalCase` for components | `kebab-case`                 | `user-profile.tsx` or `UserProfile/index.tsx` |

#### Critical Rules

These rules are specific to our project and are designed to prevent common mistakes, especially when using an AI agent.

-   **Type Sharing:** Always define shared TypeScript interfaces and types (e.g., `Comment`, `UserProfile`) in the `packages/shared` directory. Import them from there to ensure type consistency across the entire monorepo.
-   **Data Access:** Never make direct API calls or data fetching logic from a React component. Always use a function from the **Data Access Layer** to fetch, update, or mutate data.
-   **Environment Variables:** Never access `process.env` directly in the application code. All environment variables must be accessed through a centralized and type-safe configuration object (e.g., a `.env.d.ts` file or a Zod-validated object).
-   **Error Handling:** All Server Actions must return a structured response, either a successful payload or a structured `ApiError` object, as defined in the **API Contract**.
-   **Database Operations:** All database interactions (Upstash Redis commands) must be encapsulated within a Next.js Server Action and not performed directly within a React component.
-   **UI Component Usage:** When using Shadcn UI components, always prefer to extend and wrap them in your own `components/custom` directory rather than modifying the generated files directly.

# Architect Solution Validation Report

**Executive Summary**

The architecture document is in a **HIGH** state of readiness. It is a comprehensive and well-structured blueprint that aligns perfectly with the project's goals and requirements. No critical risks were identified, and the technical decisions are sound and pragmatic. The document is ready to be handed off to the development team.

| **9. AI Agent Implementation Suitability** | ✅ PASS    | None                                          |
| **10. Accessibility Implementation**       | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Missing a dedicated plan for WCAG compliance. |

**Critical Deficiencies**

-   **Accessibility Plan:** The document mentions accessibility in a general sense, but lacks a dedicated plan for implementing and testing against a specific standard like WCAG. While not a blocker for core development, this is a crucial step for a production-ready application.

**Recommendations**

-   **Must Fix:** There are no critical deficiencies that block development. The document is ready to proceed.
-   **Should Fix (for better quality):** It is highly recommended to create a dedicated section or add a sub-section to **`Frontend Design & Implementation`** that outlines a clear plan for accessibility, including the compliance target (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA) and the tools and testing methods to be used.

**AI Implementation Readiness**

The architecture document is extremely well-suited for AI agent implementation. It provides:

-   A clear, monorepo **Source Tree** for file organization.
-   Explicit **Coding Standards** and conventions to prevent inconsistent code.
-   Precise **Data Models** and **API Contracts** to minimize hallucination.
-   Detailed **Core Workflows** with diagrams that a development agent can follow.

The blueprint is ready to be handed off to the development team for execution.
