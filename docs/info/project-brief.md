# Project Brief: My Tech & Resume Blog

**Executive Summary**

The product is a personal blog and portfolio site dedicated to sharing knowledge and experiences in High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) in an easy-to-digest manner. The primary problem being solved is the lack of accessible, practical, and visually engaging content for young tech professionals and aspiring engineers who want to improve their design skills. The target market consists of junior and mid-level developers who want to learn how to approach complex systems. The key value proposition is to provide a curated resource of interactive design case studies, personal projects, and professional insights that serve as both a learning tool for the community and a dynamic professional portfolio for the creator.

**Problem Statement**

The current landscape of system design resources for High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) is fragmented and often lacks a cohesive, visually appealing approach. Many tutorials and guides present concepts in disparate ways across different platforms, which can be confusing and overwhelming for aspiring engineers and young developers. There is a need for a centralized, well-structured resource that provides clear, easy-to-digest guides and real-world case studies in a consistent format. My goal is to address this by increasing my industry presence as a full-stack developer and providing a valuable, single source of truth for design best practices.

**Proposed Solution**

The solution is to create a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) that functions as both a professional portfolio and a technical blog. It will serve as a centralized hub for High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) guides, offering a consistent and visually appealing resource. The blog content will be uniquely structured into two primary sections for each article: a **"Theory"** section to explain core concepts and a separate **"Implementation"** section featuring practical code examples and snippets. This clear separation will make complex topics easy to digest, while the hands-on examples will help readers apply the knowledge immediately.

The key differentiators are this structured, two-part approach and a commitment to modern, aesthetic design. While many existing resources are fragmented or visually unappealing, this blog will stand out by providing a consistent user experience and a high-quality visual identity. This integrated approach, combining a professional portfolio with valuable educational content, will succeed by addressing a clear gap in the market and establishing the creator's industry presence.

**Target Users**

#### Primary User Segment: Young Graduates and Aspiring Engineers

This segment includes recent computer science graduates, self-taught developers, and junior to mid-level engineers (typically 0-5 years of experience) who are keen to deepen their understanding of system design. Their key needs are practical, digestible, and visually engaging content that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application of HLD and LLD principles. They often face challenges with fragmented resources, overwhelming complexity in existing guides, and a desire to improve their problem-solving and architectural thinking skills to advance their careers.

#### Secondary User Segment: Recruiters, Senior Developers, and Tech Journalists

This segment comprises hiring managers and technical recruiters actively seeking qualified full-stack developers, senior developers looking for concise refreshers or alternative perspectives on system design, and tech journalists or content creators scouting for innovative content and expert contributors. Their goals when visiting the site would be to quickly assess the creator's technical expertise, communication style, and industry relevance, as well as to discover valuable, well-explained technical content.

**MVP Scope**

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for your blog site will focus on delivering a core set of features that provide immediate value to your target audience while establishing your online presence. The primary goal is to launch a functional, visually appealing platform that effectively showcases your resume and facilitates knowledge sharing in HLD and LLD.

#### Core Features (Must Have)

-   **Interactive Resume Display:** A dedicated section that presents your resume details in an engaging and interactive format, highlighting key achievements, experience, and skills. This will serve as a dynamic professional portfolio.
-   **Blog Post Functionality:**
    -   **Article Display:** Ability to view individual blog articles.
    -   **Two-Part Content Structure:** Each article will clearly separate **"Theory"** (conceptual explanations) and **"Implementation"** (practical code examples/snippets with syntax highlighting).
    -   **Basic Content Organization:** Support for categories and tags to help users navigate content (e.g., LLD, HLD, specific technologies).
-   **User Engagement Features:**
    -   **Article Like Counter:** A simple mechanism for users to "like" blog posts, indicating appreciation for content.
    -   **Comment Section with Social Login:** Integration of a third-party commenting system (e.g., Disqus, Hyvor Talk) allowing users to log in via LinkedIn or Google to post comments on articles.
-   **Core Pages:**
    -   **Homepage:** An inviting landing page that introduces the blog and highlights recent content or your professional summary.
    -   **About Me Page:** A page detailing your professional journey, passions, and background beyond the resume.
    -   **Contact Page/Section:** Clear ways for recruiters or collaborators to get in touch with you.
-   **Responsive Design:** The entire site must be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
-   **Basic SEO Optimization:** Fundamental SEO practices (e.g., clean URLs, meta descriptions for pages/posts) to ensure discoverability by search engines.

#### Out of Scope for MVP

-   **Advanced Commenting Features:** Nested replies beyond one level, complex moderation dashboards (relying on third-party service's default tools), or advanced user profiles within the commenting system.
-   **Extensive Analytics Dashboards:** While data tracking will be implemented, an internal, custom dashboard for analytics is outside the MVP scope (relying on external tools like GA4 for now).
-   **User Registration/Profile Management:** Beyond social logins for commenting, full user accounts or profile management on your site are not included.
-   **Complex Search Functionality:** An advanced, faceted search (e.g., searching within code snippets) is out of scope; a basic keyword search will suffice.
-   **Monetization Features:** Any form of advertising, paid content, or donation options.
-   **Multi-language Support:** The blog will initially be in one language.

#### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

-   The core website and its resume and blog sections are deployed and accessible online.
-   Users can navigate the site easily and consume content effectively across devices.
-   Engagement metrics (page visits, likes, comments) show initial positive trends, validating the value proposition.
-   Recruiters and senior developers can easily find and assess your expertise through the site.
