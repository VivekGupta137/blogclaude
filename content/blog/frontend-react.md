# React Hooks Deep Dive

This is a comprehensive guide to understanding React hooks and how to use them effectively in your applications.

## Theory

React hooks provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class component.

## Implementation

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
