# Technical Summary

The system will be a modern, **static site generated application (SSG) with client-side interactivity**, focused on delivering a rich user experience for consuming technical content. It will primarily leverage a **component-based frontend framework** to present interactive resume details and a structured blog with "Theory" and "Implementation" sections. The application will be deployed as static assets for optimal performance and scalability, with dynamic content (like comments and visitor metrics) managed through integration with **third-party services and client-side JavaScript**. This architecture prioritizes visual appeal, content delivery, and ease of maintenance, supporting the goal of establishing a strong industry presence.
