## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1, the monorepo structure is established with:

-   Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router in `apps/web/`
-   Shared TypeScript types in `packages/shared/src/`
-   Content directory structure already established with `content/blog/`
-   Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components configured and ready to use

### Architecture Context

**System Architecture**: [Source: architecture/technical-summary.md]
The system is a modern, static site generated application (SSG) with client-side interactivity, using a component-based frontend framework following Jamstack architectural style with content pre-rendered at build time.

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/system-components.md]

-   Frontend: Next.js (SSG), React 19.x.x, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, MagicUI
-   Data Layer: React Query / SWR, TypeScript
-   Build Process: Next.js built-in SSG

**Content Management**: [Source: architecture/high-level-overview.md]
Content will be managed as files within the repository (Markdown/JSON), processed by the Static Site Generator.

**File Locations** based on established monorepo structure:

-   Resume page: `apps/web/app/resume/page.tsx`
-   Resume data: `content/resume/` directory
-   Shared types: `packages/shared/src/` (add resume-related interfaces)
-   Components: `apps/web/components/` (if reusable components needed)

**Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
While the architecture focuses on BlogPost models, similar patterns should be followed for resume data:

-   Structured data with clear TypeScript interfaces
-   Metadata extraction for static generation
-   Use of proper typing for all data structures

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards**: [Source: Story 1.1 implementation]

-   Test file location: `__tests__` directory or `.test.tsx` files alongside components
-   Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured)
-   Unit tests for components and interactive functionality
-   Responsive design testing

### Technical Constraints

-   Must use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)
-   TypeScript is required throughout
-   Must follow established monorepo structure
-   Static content generation for optimal performance
-   Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
-   Must integrate with existing Shadcn UI component system

**Error Handling Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Implement graceful error handling for data loading
-   Use structured error patterns consistent with project standards
-   Ensure interactive elements handle edge cases

**Logging Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

-   Use structured logging for any dynamic functionality
-   Never log sensitive resume data

### Project Structure Notes

The resume page aligns with the existing project structure:

-   Follows App Router conventions in `apps/web/app/resume/`
-   Content stored in `content/resume/` following established content patterns
-   TypeScript interfaces in shared package maintain consistency
-   Component architecture supports the static site generation approach

## Testing

### Testing Standards

Based on architecture requirements and Story 1.1 implementation:

-   Test file location: Follow Next.js testing conventions with `__tests__` directories or `.test.tsx` files
-   Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured in monorepo)
-   Testing requirements:
    -   Unit tests for resume page component
    -   Tests for interactive elements (state changes, user interactions)
    -   Responsive design validation
    -   Data loading and rendering tests
    -   Accessibility testing for resume content
