# User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision

The primary UX goal is to create a seamless, professional, and content-first experience. The design will be clean and intuitive, ensuring that users can easily find and engage with technical articles and your resume without distraction. The interface will prioritize readability, clarity, and performance.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms

The site will feature fluid, responsive interactions that feel modern and polished. Navigation should be straightforward, with a clear information hierarchy that guides users from a high-level overview (homepage) to specific content (blog post). Micro-interactions and subtle animations from MagicUI and Shadcn will enhance the user experience without being distracting.

#### Core Screens and Views

-   Homepage: Introduces your professional brand and showcases the most recent or popular blog posts.
-   About Me Page: Provides a detailed, personal narrative to complement your resume.
-   Interactive Resume Page: A dynamic, scannable page presenting your skills and work history.
-   Blog Post List Page: An organized and searchable list of all blog posts with key metadata (title, summary, tags).
-   Individual Blog Post Page: The primary content view with the "Theory" and "Implementation" sections, as well as the comment section and social interaction features.

#### Accessibility: None

_This is an assumption._ We have not discussed a specific accessibility compliance level. For the MVP, we will aim for general accessibility best practices but will not target a formal standard like WCAG AA unless specified.

#### Branding

The branding will be defined by a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic. It will leverage the design patterns of Shadcn UI and MagicUI. No external brand guidelines or style guides are to be followed at this time.

#### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

_This is an assumption._ The application will be designed as a single, responsive web application that adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
